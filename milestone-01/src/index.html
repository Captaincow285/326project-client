            <p>
                Music is a meaningful way for people to communicate thoughts, emotions, and other aspects of
                the human experience to one another. Sharing what songs, artists, and genres one is listening
                to is a form of socializing that is highly demanded by many. However, today's most popular
                music streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) do not provide outlets for users to
                easily share their music tastes on a broad scale. TuneShare aims to address this issue by
                offering a place for music listeners to share Spotify playlists with not just their friends,
                but all users of the site. Similar to traditional social media platforms, our application will
                have features that allow users with an account to post playlists, upvote or downvote the
                playlists of others, suggest additions to playlists, and more.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Playlist Sharing:
                At the heart of TuneShare is the ability for users to share their curated
                Spotify playlists with others. Users can easily upload their playlists to
                the platform, making them accessible to the entire TuneShare community. This
                feature enables music lovers to discover new tracks, explore different genres,
                and connect with like-minded individuals who share similar musical tastes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Social Interaction:
                TuneShare incorporates social media elements to enhance user engagement and
                interaction. Users can follow each other, like and comment on playlists, and
                engage in discussions about their favorite tracks and artists. This social
                aspect of the platform fosters a sense of community among users, creating
                opportunities for meaningful connections and collaborations based on shared
                musical interests.
            </p>
            <p>
                Playlist Curation:
                In addition to sharing playlists, TuneShare empowers users to curate and customize their
                music collections. Users can create personalized playlists tailored to specific moods,
                occasions, or themes, and fine-tune them with the help of community feedback and suggestions.
                This collaborative approach to playlist curation ensures that users can discover high-quality
                playlists curated by both themselves and other music enthusiasts on the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                By combining these critical components, TuneShare aims to provide a seamless
                and immersive music-sharing experience that transcends the limitations of
                traditional streaming services. Whether users are looking to showcase their
                favorite tracks, discover new music, or connect with fellow music enthusiasts,
                TuneShare offers a vibrant and inclusive platform where the universal language
                of music can be shared and celebrated.

            <h2>
                Data Requirements
            </h2>
            <p>
                Structuring the data of our application will be crucial for
                scalability and ease of development. For our project, we will need to
                store four types of data: users, playlists, votes, and comments.
            </p>
            <p>
                User authentication will be a cornerstone of our application. Each
                user will have a unique identifier, "UserID", which will be crucial
                for linking users to playlists, comments, and votes. Beyond a unique
                identifier, we will store each user&apos;s email address, username,
                and password. For security, we will run passwords through a hash
                function, so we will not have direct access to the user's passwords.
                Storing this information will be important for account creation and
                login purposes. Optional information we may keep track of may include
                profile pictures and bios.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upvotes and downvotes are a simple way to gauge the quality and
                popularity of playlists posted on our platform. We wish to keep track
                of which user cast a vote, as well as if it is an upvote or downvote.
                For this we will assign each vote a "VoteID", the "PlaylistID" of the
                post the vote is cast on, the "UserID" of the user who cast the vote,
                and a field such as "IsUpvote" to distinguish types of votes. By
                modeling votes in this way, we hope to allow users to influence the
                ranking of playlists posted on the platform seamlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comments serve to add a layer of interaction and discussion between
                users. To implement a comment system we will need to keep track of the
                "UserID" of the user that posted the comment, the "PlaylistID" of the
                post where the comment resides, as well as a timestamp to display the
                age of a comment, and of course the content of the comment itself.
                Optionally we may add features such as replying to comments, and an
                upvote/downvote system for comments.
            </p>
            <p>
                The playlist data model will serve as the heart of the application,
                the primary content around which users interact with. Each playlist
                will have a unique "PlaylistID", as well as a "UserID" to associate
                the user who submitted the playlist. We will have a field for the URL
                of the playlist on Spotify, which will be especially important when
                fetching information such as the tracklist and cover image. Other
                fields we wish to include are the title, description, and creation
                timestamp. The handling of playlist data via the Spotify API will be
                an essential part of our application. Data will be fetched using the
                Spotify URL asynchronously and loaded onto the page. This will ensure
                that every playlist posted on the site is always up-to-date.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, the thoughtful structuring and management of data will
                ensure our application is scalable. By carefully designing data models
                for users, votes, comments, and playlists, we lay the groundwork for a
                dynamic and secure platform.

                The application will consist of three main windows, one for viewing and sorting a list of playlists, one
                for viewing individual playlists and their tracks, and one for viewing users and their posted playlists.
                Users will be able to view playlists in a list format. Playlists will be able to be sorted in many ways
                including, by popularity, date added, etc. This page will display playlist names, the user who posted
                the playlist, and its current vote count. Optionally, we may include genre tags, but this is not a
                must-have feature.

                will be displayed an optional cover image, title, description, the user who posted the playlist, as well

                joined, their profile description, and optional profile photo.

                This project is a rudimentary social media platform geared towards
                the sharing of musical preferences and the exploration of a world of
                tunes. It is incredibly common for people to share their music
                preferences with their friends; anyone who is decently active on the
                internet may see their friends or other internet denizens share
                individual songs or full playlists via Twitter, Spotify, Instagram,
                Discord, or other social media platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Traditional music streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music
                primarily focus on personalized recommendations and curated playlists
                based on individual user preferences. While these platforms excel at
                delivering personalized content, they lack robust features for users
                to share and discover music with a broader audience. As a result,
                music sharing often remains confined to social media platforms or
                face-to-face interactions, hindering the potential for meaningful
                connections and collaborations among music lovers.
            </p>
            <p>
                TuneShare aims to bridge this gap by providing a dedicated platform
                for music enthusiasts to share, discover, and collaborate on playlists
                with a global community of users. By offering features such as
                playlist sharing, social interaction, and collaborative playlist
                curation, TuneShare empowers users to connect with like-minded
                individuals, explore diverse musical genres, and discover new tracks
                beyond their usual playlists.

                The creation and deployment of Tuneshare will serve as an important
                collaborative experience for the members of this group. Via the
                development of this application, group members will draw on classroom
                experience in data analysis, human-centered design, data structures, and
                simple algorithms to collaborate on an application that resembles commonly
                available technologies Being similar to real technologies in use, this
                integrative experience provides group members with context and understanding
                of how to apply their skills to real-world situations. The collaborative
                project-based nature of this assignment closely mimics a workplace
                environment, forcing group members to develop and utilize communication
                and management skills to keep the project on schedule. Through this project,
                students will gain experience in a development environment, preparing them
                for post-undergraduate experiences.
